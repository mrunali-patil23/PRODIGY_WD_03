# To build a tic-tac-toe web application
This is brief summary of the task.
# Task Summary:
The task is to build a tic-tac-toe web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow users to play against each other or against an AI opponent. Key functionalities include handling user clicks, tracking game state, and checking for winning conditions.
#  Steps
1) Set Up the HTML Structure: Create the basic structure of the web page, including the game 
   board and any necessary buttons or elements.
2) Style with CSS: Apply styles to make the game board visually appealing and user-friendly.

4) Update the UI Dynamically: Ensure that the UI updates dynamically based on user 
   interactions and game state changes.
5) Test and Debug: Thoroughly test the application to ensure it works as expected and debug 
   any issues.
6) Deploy: Once the application is complete and bug-free, deploy it to a web server for users 
   to access.
# Features
